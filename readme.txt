BRAINSTORMING (26 March)

x game where you're stuck in the back of a queue & you have to get to the front
x app that rings studylink
x where's wally, but wally is invisible
x app that takes you to a site or youtube video with 0 views
- google maps game thats drops you in a random city (similar to geoguessr) and you have to find the nearest airport
> runner rhythm game where level is based on music. multiple songs with randomised sections, you can play forever or beat your score
x rudimentary music-making app
x note-taking with collapsible notes
- task management but gameified where completing tasks lets you grow and design a creature (like spore?)

- Auto-runner rhythm game where inputs are synced to music
- Multiple songs to chose from. Each song is made up of different sections whose order is randomised, so you can learn the inputs for specific sections, but you never know the overall structure.
- Player needs to input to jump over pits, duck under objects etc. Precise timing is very important, leanring the music helps with this.
- Player can only miss a vertain number of inputs before game ends. Optional health recovery?
- Think Vib-Ribbon (1999) but more intense, requiring more inputs from the player, and the level layouts are not generated from the player's own music.

We are all interested building a game, we have two members experienced in music production, and we have two members experienced in visual design, so a rhythm game feels pretty apt
